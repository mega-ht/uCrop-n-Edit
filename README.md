#### Non-Native Version
# uCrop'n'Edit - Image Cropping and Editing Library for Android

This repository is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/krokyze/uCrop-n-Edit">uCrop'n'Edit</a>, which is in turn a fork of <a href="https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop">uCrop</a>. I fixed some bugs, updated the dependencies and gradle, and converted much of the code to Kotlin. Furthermore, I added the option to use an ActivityResultLauncher instead of onActivityResult which is deprecated. In addition, in the changelogs you can see all other features I added.

# Features

<a href="https://github.com/krokyze/uCrop-n-Edit">uCrop'n'Edit</a> extends <a href="https://github.com/Yalantis/uCrop">uCrop</a> by adding the ability to change Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Sharpness of images. I updated everything and added a few things. You can see all changes in the changelog.

<img align="right" src="preview.gif" width="150" height="280"/>

* image compression format (e.g. PNG, JPEG, WEBP), compression
* image compression quality [0 - 100]. PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting.
* change Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, and Sharpness of images
* whether all gestures are enabled simultaneously
* maximum size for Bitmap that is decoded from source Uri and used within crop view. If you want to override the default behaviour.
* toggle whether to show crop frame/guidelines
* setup color/width/count of crop frame/rows/columns
* choose whether you want rectangle or oval(`options.setCircleDimmedLayer(true)`) crop area
* the UI colors (Toolbar, StatusBar, active widget state)
* and more...

# Native vs Non-Native Version

I have split this repository into two separate branches:  
- **Native**: `master`, `develop`
- **Non-Native**: `master-non-native`, `develop-non-native`

### Reason for the Split

The main reason for this split was the need for **WebP** file format support. While it is possible to implement this in the native version using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) as an additional layer for file handling (as mentioned [here](https://cimg.eu/reference/structcimg__library_1_1CImg.html)), I currently don't have the time to do so.

If someone has the time and interest to implement this, I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to submit a pull request!

### Key Differences Between the Versions

- **Native Version**:
  - Supports only JPEG, PNG, BMP, and [a few more formats](http://www.cimg.eu/reference/io.html).
  
- **Non-Native Version**:
  - Supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, **WebP**, and possibly other [Android-supported image formats](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/supported-formats#image-formats) (untested).

# Usage

1. Include the library as a local library project in your build.gradle:

    ```
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
	
	...
	
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.jens-muenker:uCrop-n-Edit:version'
	}
    ```

2. Add UCropActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml

    ```
    <activity
        android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity"
        android:screenOrientation="portrait"
        android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"/>
    ```
    
    
### ActivityResultLauncher


3. Create an ActivityResultLauncher and handle uCrop result.

    ```kotlin
    private val activityResultLauncher = registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) { result ->
        if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
            val imageUri: Uri = UCrop.getOutput(result.data!!)!!
        }
    }
    ```

4. The uCrop configuration is created using the builder pattern.

    ```kotlin
    UCrop.of(sourceUri, destinationUri)
        .withAspectRatio(16, 9)
        .withMaxResultSize(maxWidth, maxHeight)
        .start(context, activityResultLauncher)
    ```

[Here](https://github.com/jens-muenker/uCrop-n-Edit/blob/master/UCrop-Options.md) you can find possible options.
